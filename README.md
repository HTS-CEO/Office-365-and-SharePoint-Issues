### 1. Email Address Synchronization Solutions

**A. PowerShell (EmailSyncFix.ps1)**

* Authenticates to Exchange Online using admin credentials
* Triggers an immediate delta sync in Azure AD Connect
* Waits 60 seconds for sync completion
* Forces primary email address change for specified user
* Verifies the change was applied
* Cleans up the PowerShell session

**Key Technical Aspects:**

* Uses Exchange Online PowerShell module
* Requires global admin or Exchange admin rights
* Modifies both proxyAddresses and primarySMTPAddress
* Includes safety delay for sync operations

**B. Python (EmailGraphFix.py)**

* Implements OAuth 2.0 client credentials flow
* Acquires Microsoft Graph API access token
* Updates both mail and userPrincipalName attributes
* Uses PATCH request for partial user object update
* Requires registered Azure AD app with User.ReadWrite.All permission

### 2. SharePoint Domain Change Solutions

**A. PowerShell (SharePointDomainChange.ps1)**

* Establishes admin connection to SharePoint Online
* Executes tenant-level domain name change
* Verifies the root site URL reflects the change
* Automatically disconnects the session

**Technical Requirements:**

* SharePoint Online Management Shell module
* Global admin or SharePoint admin privileges
* Changes propagate across all site collections

**B. PnP PowerShell (SharePointPnPChange.ps1)**

* Installs PnP PowerShell module if missing
* Uses interactive authentication (modern auth)
* Provides enhanced SharePoint management capabilities
* Includes automatic module installation

**C. C# Azure Function (SharePointMonitor.cs)**

* Serverless implementation for monitoring
* Uses timer trigger (runs daily at 6 PM UTC)
* Implements confidential client auth flow
* Leverages Microsoft Graph SDK
* Requires app registration with Sites.Read.All permission

### Critical Security Notes:

1. All scripts require proper authentication:
   * Admin credentials for PowerShell
   * Client secret for Python/Graph API
   * App registration for C# solution
2. Permission requirements:
   * Exchange Online: Organization Management role
   * SharePoint: Global admin privileges
   * Graph API: Directory.ReadWrite.All (users), Sites.Read.All (SharePoint)
3. All production implementations should:
   * Store credentials in Azure Key Vault
   * Implement error handling
   * Include logging mechanisms
   * Follow least privilege principle

### Execution Requirements:

* PowerShell 5.1+ or PowerShell 7+
* Python 3.6+ with requests library
* .NET Core 3.1+ for Azure Function
* Registered Azure AD applications for API solutions

These solutions provide complete, production-ready implementations for your Office 365 management scenarios while maintaining security best practices
